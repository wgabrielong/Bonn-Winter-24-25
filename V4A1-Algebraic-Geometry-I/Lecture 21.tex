\section{Lecture 21 -- 20th December 2024}\label{sec: lecture 21}
We state several important theorems of Serre. 
\begin{theorem}[Serre -- Global Generation]\label{def: Serre global generation}
    Let $A$ be a finite type $k$-algebra that is Noetherian as a ring and $X$ a projective $A$-scheme. If $\Fcal$ is a coherent sheaf and $\Lcal$ is a very ample invertible sheaf on $X$, then there exists $N$ such that for all $n>N$, $\Fcal\otimes_{\Ocal_{X}}\Lcal^{\otimes n}$ is finitely globally generated. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}[Serre -- Cohomology]\label{thm: Serre cohomology}
    Let $A$ be a finite type $k$-algebra that is Noetherian as a ring and $X$ a projective $A$-scheme. If $\Fcal$ is a coherent sheaf on $X$ then $\Gamma(X,\Fcal)$ is a finitely generated $A$-module. 
\end{theorem}
In particular, if $A=k$, then $\Gamma(X,\Fcal)$ is a finite dimensional $k$-vector space. 
\begin{theorem}[Serre-Grothendieck Vanishing]\label{thm: Serre-Grothendieck vanishing}
    Let $X$ be an $A$-scheme for $A$ a Noetherian ring. If $\Ocal_{X}(1)$ is very ample and $\Fcal$ a coherent sheaf on $X$ then there exists $N\in\NN$ such that for all $n>N$, $H^{i}(X,\Fcal(n))=0$ for all $i\geq 1$. 
\end{theorem}
