\section{Lecture 10 -- 17th January 2025}\label{sec: lecture 10}
We continue our discussion of relative motivic cohomology. Just as classical motivic cohomology has realization maps that recover de Rham, Betti, \'{e}tale, and prismatic cohomology, so too does relative motivic cohomology. 

Observe that we can consider the ring of integers Nahm number field 
$$R=\ZZ[t_{1},\dots,t_{N},z_{1},\dots,z_{N}]/\left(1-z_{i}=(-1)^{A_{ii}}t_{i}z_{1}^{A_{i1}}\dots z_{N}^{A_{iN}}\right)$$
of \Cref{eqn: number field of Nahm equation} as a ring over $\ZZ[t_{1},\dots,t_{N}]$. Recall that for $R=\ZZ[t,\frac{1}{1-t}]$ as discussed in \Cref{sec: lecture 9}, we can define relative motivic cohomology $H^{i}(\ZZ(n)(R/\ZZ[t^{\pm}]))$ where there is a map 
$$H^{1}(\ZZ(2)(R/\ZZ[t^{\pm}]))\longrightarrow H^{i}(\ZZ(1)(R/\ZZ[t^{\pm}]))=R[1/t]^{\times}/t^{\ZZ}$$
induced by the logarithmic derivative taking $-\Li^{\mathrm{univ}}_{2}(t)$ to $[\frac{1}{1-t}]$. Under ``de Rham realization,'' the diloagarithm class goes to $-\log(1-t)$. This theory of realizations of motivic cohomology also explains the factor $\prod_{i=0}^{m-1}(1-\zeta_{m}t)^{i/m}$ at the expansion of Nahm sums at $m$th roots of unity \Cref{thm: Nahm sum asymptotics at roots of unity}.

For $R$ a ring, motivic cohomology admits Betti and \'{e}tale realizations
$$H^{i}(R,\ZZ(n))\to H^{i}_{\mathsf{sing}}(\spec(R)(\CC),\ZZ), H^{i}(R,\ZZ(n))\to H^{i}_{\mathsf{\acute{e}t}}(\spec(R[1/m]),\ZZ/m\ZZ(n)).$$
We can describe this explicitly in motivic weight $n=1$. This produces maps $R^{\times}$ to $\ZZ$-torsors to $\spec(R)(\CC)$ taking $f$ to a $\ZZ$-torsor of choices of $\log(f)$ in the Betti setting and $R^{\times}$ to $\mu_{m}$-torsors over $\spec(R)$. Analogous constructions can be made for relative motivic cohomology. In relative motivic cohomology, the same constructions yield maps
$$H^{i}(\ZZ(n)(R/\ZZ[t^{\pm}]))\to H^{i}_{\mathsf{sing}}\left(\spec(R)(\CC)\times_{(\CC^{\times})^{N}}\CC^{N}\right)$$
$$ H^{i}(\ZZ(n)(R/\ZZ[t^{\pm}]))\to H^{i}_{\mathsf{\acute{e}t}}\left(\spec(R[1/m, t_{1}^{1/m},\dots,t_{N}^{1/m}]),\ZZ/m\ZZ(n)\right)$$
where in the first case we the fibered product is taken over the map $\exp:\CC^{N}\to(\CC^{\times})^{N}$. Here, we observe that relative motivic cohomology still give \'{e}tale cohomology classes, but these only start to appear after extracting some roots of the coordinates. 

In this framework, it can be seen that the Betti realization of the diloagarithm is a well-defined function on $\CC\setminus(2\pi i)\ZZ$ with at most simple poles at $(2\pi i)\ZZ$, and residues $\pm(2\pi i)n$ at $2\pi i n$. In particular, the diloagarithm realizes to a $\ZZ$-local system on $\CC\setminus(2\pi i)\ZZ$ whose mononodromy around $2\pi i n$ is $n$. Similarly, the \'{e}tale realization produces precisely the product $\prod_{i=0}^{m-1}(1-\zeta_{m}t)^{i/m}$ alluded to above. This recovers a construction of Calegari-Garoufalidis-Zagier as well as the cyclic quantum dilogarithm.
